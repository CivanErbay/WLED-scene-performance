# WLED-scene-performance
A VJ web app interface for WLED devices. Live performance, scene composition, timeline editor with MIDI interaction.

This aim of this application is to add a level of hardware interaction for live performances and complex multi-device compositions to [WLED projects](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED). Imagine a music band where each instrument is a WLED device and this web app allows you to become the orhestrator.

# Use Cases
At [Lichtblick Kollektiv](http://lichtblick-kollektiv.de/) we create interactive light installations, typically using several instances of LED powered sculptures. After trying custom implementations, the perfomance of WLED proved to have the best performance by far. However this reach featured software may be confusing to non-technical users and does not include a scene or timeline editor (such as in VJ or DAW software like Ableton). Ultimately, a user should be able to desgin and preview a light effect, queue and assign it to one or multiple WLED instances, combine constellations of these patterns and devices in scenes and record a sequence of scenes with parameter modulation for playback.
